Ansible is a push based config system.
No need of agent configuration.
configuration is set using YAML { English Like }.
Architecture is saimple, Easy to get started with.
Simple SSH is all we need.
Ansible is build on Python

2 things to remember - Inventory and Playbooks.

# Installing Ansible 
sudo dnf install -y ansible-core

# Checking Version
ansible --version

# setting up nodes

anisble all -m ping { check for connection }

# Generate a key
ssh-keygen

# copy ssh key from master to authorize key hosts
cp ./ssh/id_rsa.pub ./sshautorizedkeys





# Inventory 
=> It's a file which has collection of all the servers (worker nodes)
default location  :/etc/ansible/hosts

If you want to group the severs pass "" [ ]  "" square brackets.
eg [web]
192.168.100.0
192.168.100.1
192.168.100.2
192.168.100.3

group the group servers
eg [ecomm:children]
web
app

# Creating own Inventory (dynamic Inventory)
create a file "myhosts.ini"

# calling personal Inventory file pass "-i" flag
eg : ansible --list-hosts -i myhosts.ini all
ansible --list-hosts -i myhosts.ini grp1

# Adhoc Commands 
ansible all --list-hosts {list all the hosts}
ansible all -m ping {ping module to check connectivity}
ansible all -m commad -a "date" {check for date}
ansible all -m commad -a "free -m"{check for free space}

Privilages
add -b in Adhoc Commands
in Playbooks become = true

# what are Playbooks?
=> deployment and orchestration language
