If you want to group the severs pass "" [ ]  "" square brackets.
eg [web]
192.168.100.0
192.168.100.1
192.168.100.2
192.168.100.3

eg [ecomm:children]
web
app

# Creating own Inventory (dynamic Inventory)
create a file "myhosts.ini"

# calling personal Inventory file pass "-i" flag
eg : ansible --list-hosts -i myhosts.ini all
ansible --list-hosts -i myhosts.ini grp1

# Adhoc Commands 
ansible all --list-hosts {list all the hosts}
